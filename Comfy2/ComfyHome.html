<!--Intro-->
<center>
  <h3 class = "intro"> ComfyVibes is an e-commerce website that <a class = "link" href = "https://saharafathelbab.github.io/portfolio/"> my partner </a>
    and I worked on as our final project for our Internet Computing course.
    The idea behind the creation and design of ComfyVibes, was to create a clothing website that is aesthetically pleasing, easy to navigate from the user’s perspective,
    all while offering as much variety to the customer as possible with a range of options of merchandise to select from.
    With that, we decided to focus mainly on Menswear with some Womenswear as well - all comprised of jackets, sweaters, shoes, etc.
    Hope you enjoy, and wished this website was real enough to buy from! </h3>
