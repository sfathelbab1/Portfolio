<!--Intro-->

   <h4> __________</h4>
 <h3 class = "raj"> CollegeVibes - a semester long project for my Human Computer Interaction course. It is an
application created by me and my teammates (one of which is my sister <a class = "links" href = "https://saharafathelbab.github.io/portfolio/"> Sahara Fathelbab </a>) which was aimed to best assist college students in their new and sometimes overwhelming endeavors of making friends. For students using CollegeVibes, the objective was to help students utilize their pockets of free time more efficiently to ease their transition into college and making new friends.

            <p>For the Interview Stage, my team and I interviewed three students at Montclair State University regarding how they go about making friends in college.
              After finding a few patterns from the series of questions we had asked, we utilized their responses to better satisfy their needs through the features of our future application, CollegeVibes.</p>

           Target Demographic and Persona Stage - upon deciding what our target demographic would be, we came to the conclusion of choosing non-commuter, non-transfer, Freshman students at Montclair State University. After doing so, we tailored our three personas to that target demographic.
           <br>
           <br>
           In total, we created 3 Personas each of which include the Narrative, Problem Statement, Day In the Life, and Story Board.

           In Testing and Refining Our Solution, we used the program Axure to create the final result of CollegeVibes and showcased the unique features.
           In this real life scenario we interviewed a student at Montclair State University to get to know more about her, her likes and dislikes, etc..
           We then tailored the main feature of CollegeVibes that best fit her interests, which in this case was makeup. Below is a video of the student testing our application.
