    <h4> ___________________________ </h4>
  <h3 class = "raj"> Take Me to Thailand is a restaurant website that my teammates and I (one of which is my sister <a class = "link" href = "https://saharafathelbab.github.io/portfolio/"> Sahara Fathelbab </a>)
    worked on as our final project for our Software Engineering course. The functionalities and features of Take Me to Thailand each catered to the needs of the
    cutomers, managers, employees, and the owner.  The customer has the ability to order items of their choice with valid login information (the password was also hashed and encrypted for security purposes).
    Once the customer has logged in successfully, they may proceed and choose to Dine In or Pick Up upon placing their order. Managers have the ability to manage and edit inventory, as well as view information of other
    managers and employees. Employees have the ability to view the menu page, as well as other employees and their respective information. Lastly. the owner has the ability to forsee everything, manage and edit inventory, etc.
